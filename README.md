- 👋 Hi, I’m @fcabral326
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding 'new world' software development. I say new world because I started coding using Unix-C at At&t Bell-labs in 1983 but havent coded since 1995.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GIT
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...nothing yet
- 📫 How to reach me ... here I guess
